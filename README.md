    <p>Affiliate marketing for iOS applications.</p>
</div>

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

- In Xcode, go to **File > Add Package Dependencies**
- Enter `https://github.com/GoMarketMe/gomarketme-swift.git`
- Select **Up to Next Major Version**, min: **5.0.3**
- Click **Add Package**

## Usage

GoMarketMe takes only a few lines to set up.

### Step 1/3: Initialize GoMarketMe

Import the `GoMarketMe` package and initialize the SDK with your API key.

```swift
import GoMarketMe

private let goMarketMe = GoMarketMe.shared

init() {
    goMarketMe.initialize(apiKey: "API_KEY")
}
```

Replace `API_KEY` with your actual GoMarketMe API key. You can find it on the product onboarding page and under **Profile > API Key**.

### Alternative Step 1/3: Programmatic Affiliate Marketing

For apps that want to customize the user experience based on affiliate attribution, initialize GoMarketMe and read affiliate marketing data after initialization.

This enables [Programmatic Affiliate Marketing](https://gomarketme.co/programmatic-affiliate-marketing/), including affiliate-aware paywalls, personalized onboarding, promotions, and custom in-app experiences.

```swift
import GoMarketMe

private let goMarketMe = GoMarketMe.shared

init() {
    let sdk = GoMarketMe.shared
    Task {
        let data = await sdk.initialize(apiKey: "API_KEY")

        if let data {
            // maps to GoMarketMe > Affiliates > Export > id column
            print("Affiliate ID:", data.affiliate.id)

            // maps to GoMarketMe > Campaigns > [Name] > Affiliate's Revenue Split (%)
            print("Affiliate %:", data.saleDistribution.affiliatePercentage)

            // maps to GoMarketMe > Campaigns > [Name] > id in the URL
            print("Campaign ID:", data.campaign.id)

            // Use this data to customize onboarding, paywalls, promotions, or in-app experiences.
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2/3: Sync after purchase

After your app completes a purchase through StoreKit, RevenueCat, Adapty, or another in-app purchase provider, call:

```swift
await GoMarketMe.shared.syncAllTransactions()
```

If your purchase library lets you decide when to finish, acknowledge, consume, or complete the transaction, call `syncAllTransactions()` first.

```swift
let result = try await product.purchase()

switch result {
case .success(let verification):
    if case .verified(let transaction) = verification {
        
        await GoMarketMe.shared.syncAllTransactions()

        await transaction.finish()
    }
case .userCancelled, .pending:
    break
@unknown default:
    break
}
```

### Step 3/3: iOS consumables only

If your iOS app sells consumable in-app purchases, add this key to your app's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory</key>
<true/>
```

That's it. GoMarketMe automatically attributes and reports affiliate sales.
